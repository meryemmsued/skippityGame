# skippityGame
Skippity is a strategy game where players take turns jumping over pieces to collect them
The goal is to gather as many pieces as possible and achieve the highest score by the end of the game
Players move their pieces one at a time and can only make moves by jumping over other pieces. Jumping is essential to collect pieces, and as the game progresses, the number of pieces on the board decreases. The game continues until no more valid moves can be made
